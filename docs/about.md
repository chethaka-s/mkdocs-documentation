# About 
Confluence
---
We need to explore markdown plugins that would allow us to pull content directly from the markdown files in GitHub and publish them in Confluence. However, none of the plugins so far is meeting the requirements, e.g., they don’t update the content automatically when it changes in GitHub, instead appearing in a box. When creating documentation for closed-source products, it would be required to generate a unique PDF for each customer with the free and paid features their implementation includes.

Github Pages
---


GitHub Pages are built directly from markdown files in GitHub. However, there are usage limits:
GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB .
Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month.
GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.

If the site exceeds these usage quotas, we may not be able to serve your site, or you may receive a polite email from GitHub Support suggesting strategies for reducing your site's impact on our servers, including putting a third-party content distribution network (CDN) in front of your site, making use of other GitHub features, such as releases, or moving to a different hosting service that might better fit your needs.

Github Pages is especially useful for content that doesn’t change frequently. We would need to find a solution for versioning the docs as well as for generating PDFs. Products that use Github Pages use several tools in their workflow and a lot of customizations.
